    <h1>Kobe Bryant</h1>
        <p>This here page is dedicated to one of the most clutch, hard working, closest thing to Michael Jordan of all time. Kobe zigged when everyone else zagged. He not only set the bar for the work ethic of what an athlete should have, but set the bar for what the heart and mental toughness a champion should demonstrate. #Respect!

                <h2>The Genesis Of A Champ</h2>
                <p>Born in 1978 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Kobe Bryant spent his early years in Italy and joined the NBA straight out of high school. A dominant scorer, Bryant won five NBA championships and the 2008 MVP Award with the Los Angeles Lakers. Although later seasons were marred by injuries, he surpassed Michael Jordan for third place on the NBA all-time scoring list in December 2014. The following year, he announced his plan to retire after the 2015-16 NBA season.

                <h2>Early Off</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1984, after ending his NBA career, the elder Bryant took the family to Italy, where he played in the Italian League. Growing up in Italy alongside two athletic older sisters, Shaya and Sharia, Kobe was an avid player of both basketball and soccer. When the family returned to Philadelphia in 1991, Bryant joined the Lower Merion High School basketball team, leading it to the state championships four years in a row. With an eye on the NBA, he also started working out with the 76ers.
                    Though he boasted good grades and high SAT scores, Bryant decided to go straight to the NBA from high school. He was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick of the 1996 NBA draft, and was subsequently traded to the Los Angeles Lakers.

                <h2>The Legacy</h2>
                    <p>
                        In his second season as guard, with the Lakers, Bryant was voted a starter for the 1998 All-Star Game, becoming at 19 the youngest All-Star in NBA history. He then teamed up with superstar center Shaquille O'Neal to win three consecutive NBA championships, and was voted first-team all-NBA from 2002-04. He also inked multi-year endorsement deals with Adidas, Sprite and other top sponsors. 
                        In 2008, Bryant was named Most Valuable Player and carried his team to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics. In the 2009 NBA Finals, the Lakers beat the Orlando Magic to win the championship. Shortly afterward, Bryant was part of the memorial service to honor friend and music superstar Michael Jackson. The following year, the Lakers won their second straight title by defeating the Celtics.
